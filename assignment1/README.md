# CPSC 334 Assignment #1 - Fake Window

*Fake Window* is an installation created for the 6-projector setup at the Yale Center for Collaborative Arts and Media. It consists of 4 video files and a custom Processing video player. The fake window effect looks most convincing with the lights dimmed all the way and when it's dark outside.

### How to run:

1. Download the `assignment1_video_player` **folder.
2. Install Processing and download the `Video` library from the Processing Contribution Manager.
3. Open `assignment1_video_player.pde`
4. Select the video you want to run by uncommenting the relevant filename on lines 10-13. The original video files are credited below.
5. Press the *Play* button on the top-left corner of the editor.
6. When you want to close the installation, press Esc or Alt + F4.
