# CPSC 334 Assignment #1 - Fake Window

*Fake Window* is an installation created for the 6-projector setup at the Yale Center for Collaborative Arts and Media. It consists of 4 video files and a custom Processing video player. The fake window effect looks most convincing with the lights dimmed all the way and when it's dark outside.
